Title: Feature Cards
Priority: UNKNOWN | Risk: unknown | Owner: unknown
Summary: - short bullets describing the behaviour

Acceptance Criteria → Capabilities:
- CAP-1 (AC-1): deterministic checks a reviewer can run manually
  Test types: integration, unit
    • SC-01 [happy_path]: Validate deterministic checks a reviewer can run manually
      Assumptions: A-001, A-002
    • SC-02 [idempotency]: Repeated execution of deterministic checks a reviewer can run manually is idempotent
      Assumptions: A-003

Assumption Ledger:
- A-001 (medium): CAP-1: clarify trigger condition [default=Document behaviour with product/QA follow-up.]
- A-002 (medium): CAP-1: clarify observable outcome [default=Document behaviour with product/QA follow-up.]
- A-003 (medium): CAP-1: repeated trigger should be idempotent [default=Repeated invocation preserves state.]

Repository Signals:
- Languages: javascript, python, typescript
- Test frameworks: pytest
- Known events: .codex_ci, local, logs, runtime, utf-8
